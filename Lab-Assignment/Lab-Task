2.	Project should be done on laptop/ raspberry pi 
3.	Redhat / fedora / Raspbian operating system (Windows operating system not allowed)
4.	Connect raspberry pi or laptop using LAN / Wi-Fi
5.	Ping both devices
6.	Create buffer by using FIFO at each node.
7.	Buffer occupancy will be given by:
a.	B (t+1)= B(t) + B(i) - B(o)
8.	Child and parent both will generate get data from child
9.	Parent will send a signal to child to slow down
10.	Transport data using UDP/TCP/RTP.

Input: Data rate at both PCâ€™s
Output: 
1: Data rate (at both PCs), at second PC data rate will be double of 1st PC in output) 
2: instantaneous Buffer occupancy (Buffer condition after each second, Increase data rate in case of buffer underflow, and decrease data rate in case of buffer overflow)
Increase and decrease instructions should be performed by child node. Moreover, Instruction will be given by parent node to child node in case of buffer overflow and buffer underflow.
